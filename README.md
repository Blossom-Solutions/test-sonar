    docker-compose up --build
  
  To access the frontend go to the following url:
  

    http://localhost:3000/

## Notes
Due to the absence of time to truly make this project shine, some stuff may be lacking such as a beautiful design, react deep tests, or fully CRUD'd apis.
That being said, everything is functional according to the requirements, the setup includes pre-population of the database for ease of use in the project as requested.
